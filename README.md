# Hangman-ASM 🎮

Ever wanted to play a classic Hangman game… but in Assembly?  
This is a terminal-based implementation of Hangman written in low-level x86 Assembly language, built as a personal project in 2025.

This project helped me understand memory management, loops, string processing, and system calls — all without high-level abstractions.
